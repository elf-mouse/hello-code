## Analyzing Load Order II

### Function Declaration

```js
function theBridgeOfHoistingDoom() {
  function balrog() {
    return "fire";
  }
  var ring;
  function elf() {
    return "pointy ears";
  }
  ring = wizard;
  wizard = balrog;
  return wizard();
  function balrog() {
    return "whip";
  }
  function wizard() {
    return "white";
  }
  var power = ring();
  return elf();
  function elf() {
    return "immortal";
  }
}
```

### Step 1

> All declared variables are first manually initialized to an `undefined` value and come first in the load order.

Okay so which ones are our declared variables? It looks like it's just ring and power, because the other variables are assignments, not initial declarations.

So our first step is to hoist these variables to the top and set them to `undefined`.

```js
function theBridgeOfHoistingDoom() {
  var ring = undefined;
  var power = undefined;
  function balrog() {
    return "fire";
  }
  function elf() {
    return "pointy ears";
  }
  ring = wizard;
  wizard = balrog;
  return wizard();
  function balrog() {
    return "whip";
  }
  function wizard() {
    return "white";
  }
  power = ring();
  return elf();
  function elf() {
    return "immortal";
  }
}
```

Notice also that I moved the `var` ring statement to the top, but for `power` I moved the declaration up and then left the assignment where it was.

### Step 2

> All loaded functions that end up being overwritten by other functions with the same name will just disappear from their current place in the load order (and will not be seen in your answer).

The key here is that "loaded functions" are referring to the function declarations. It shouldn't be too hard to figure that out because they're all function declarations. So we could possibly just say "All functions..." but I think the idea is that the more you get exposed to terminology like "loaded functions" and "function declarations" and "function expressions" then hopefully you'll be able to intuitively know what they are.

The first thing we know is that all of our loaded functions are going to move up anyway after our variable declarations at the top. Let's see what that looks like:

```js
function theBridgeOfHoistingDoom() {
  var ring = undefined;
  var power = undefined;
  function balrog() {
    return "fire";
  }
  function elf() {
    return "pointy ears";
  }
  function balrog() {
    return "whip";
  }
  function wizard() {
    return "white";
  }
  function elf() {
    return "immortal";
  }
  ring = wizard;
  wizard = balrog;
  return wizard();
  power = ring();
  return elf();
}
```

Now things are starting to look like they make more sense! Our variables are initialized at the very top. And then we have all our functions declared together.

What Step 2 is saying, is that we can remove the functions that are being overwritten. In the previous challenge we already saw that if you have two functions with the same name, the one on the bottom will overwrite the one on top.

In other words, we have two functions named `balrog()` and two functions named `elf()`. The bottom ones will overwrite the ones above, so we can just delete the first instances of those functions.

```js
function theBridgeOfHoistingDoom() {
  var ring = undefined;
  var power = undefined;
  function balrog() {
    return "whip";
  }
  function wizard() {
    return "white";
  }
  function elf() {
    return "immortal";
  }
  ring = wizard;
  wizard = balrog;
  return wizard();
  power = ring();
  return elf();
}
```

### Step 3

> Functions that end up replacing other functions, however, will NOT take the order place of the previous version, but instead will just fall into the load order behind existing loaded functions.

The cool part about Step 3 is that we already took care of this. We just deleted the top 2 functions (`balrog()` and `elf()`). And we left the second instances of the functions with those same names alone.

So now we have our variables taken care of at the top, and our functions defined after that:

```js
var ring = undefined;
var power = undefined;
function balrog() {
  return "whip";
}
function wizard() {
  return "white";
}
function elf() {
  return "immortal";
}
```

### Step 4

> All unreachable executable code that follows a `return` statement will disappear from your answer.

Here's our function again right now:

```js
function theBridgeOfHoistingDoom() {
  var ring = undefined;
  var power = undefined;
  function balrog() {
    return "whip";
  }
  function wizard() {
    return "white";
  }
  function elf() {
    return "immortal";
  }
  ring = wizard;
  wizard = balrog;
  return wizard();
  power = ring();
  return elf();
}
```

See how there are two return statements? That doesn't make much sense, because once a function reaches a return statement the function is done! That means that anything after return `wizard();` is extraneous. And this is what our function looks like if we remove it:

```js
function theBridgeOfHoistingDoom() {
  var ring = undefined;
  var power = undefined;
  function balrog() {
    return "whip";
  }
  function wizard() {
    return "white";
  }
  function elf() {
    return "immortal";
  }
  ring = wizard;
  wizard = balrog;
  return wizard();
}
```

### Solution

And that should work pretty well as your final solution. Basically we took care of all these so that the order looks okay:

1. variable initialization
2. function declaration order
3. left other assignments alone
4. return statement
5. remove extraneous code
